1. Create a struct with t, x, y.  Now "evolve time" for t = 0, 20

   Take an initial velocity (v) and an angle and evolve the trajectory of a projectile.
   
   If you start at 0, keep computing until y < 0.
   
   
2. references


3. pointers

   create a string
   loop over the characters with iterators
   wherever we find space, capitalize the letter after (toupper)
   
   you'll need to have logic in the loop that detects if it ==
   string.begin(), and also keeps track of whether there is a space,
   and if so, remembers to update the next character
